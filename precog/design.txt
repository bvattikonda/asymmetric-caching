 Precog-server(psrv)
=====================
- Receive user actions from the phone, and store in the files locally, both 
- Parse the files to create user action tree and compute hit counts per action

- Order the action tree nodes based on the hit count and decide the 
- Run baseline dedup hashing, caching and using it for downstream traffic 
- All metrics can be calculated at the server, as symmetric case

METRICS:
=======
- Order the action tree nodes based on the hit count and decide the actions to be preplayed
- Trigger SlimerJS to preplay these actions in a directory
- Push downloaded content from the directory to mobile phone
- Run baseline dedup hashing, caching and using it for downstream traffic

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- Number of bytes send downstream over WiFi
- Number of bytes sent downstream over cellular
- Matching bytes in cellular data and prefetch cache

=====================
 Precog-client(pcli)
=====================
1. Detect if mobile is on WiFi or cellular

2. If on WiFi:
- Send user actions upstream to source (transfer all data files) 
- Ask precog-server to send prefetched data downstream
- Run baseline dedup unhashing and inflating the packets and storing them in cache

3. If on cellular:
- Trigger Firefox extension to enable creation of data files which store actions of users
OR
Send the connectivity and action data files upstream so server can choose which actions to learn history from
- Run baseline dedup while natural network access of user. 
- Remember hashes of new packets
